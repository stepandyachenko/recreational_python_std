I have no idea what i am doing but I will use this stuff to make my life easier during recreational programming with my friends. This .py will be used to test the functions that I write by either ap-
plying the decorators implemented here or using function wrappers to test multiple functions
together, removing the need to manually print the returns and comparing them among each other. I
don't currently know what else I will want to implement
